Hi there!

I'm a Flutter Developer based in Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ.

In my spare time, I enjoy developing a variety of packages ðŸ˜Ž. You can check them out here: https://pub.dev/publishers/k9i.app/packages

I'm also a big fan of the [Riverpod] package and have had the opportunity to contribute to it ðŸ¥³. Here are a few of my contributions:

1. https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/pull/2274
2. https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/pull/2306

Thanks for stopping by my profile!
